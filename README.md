- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cristinastan-pm
- 👀 I’m interested in  transforming ideas into impactful digital products and transitioning fully into a Product Owner role. With a strong background in project management, I'm excited to focus on building user-centered solutions and guiding products from concept to launch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning product strategy, UX design, and creating roadmaps that guide products from concept to launch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on open-source projects where I can apply my expertise in product lifecycles, feature prioritization, and delivering great user experiences.
- 📫 How to reach me at - stan.cristina@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not managing products, I’m testing out beaches around the world—because someone has to find the best spots for sunset views and beachside brainstorming sessions!
